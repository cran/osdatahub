To restrict your API query to a certain area, you'll need to define an "extent".
The extent object is represented in `osdatahub` R package as an object of type
`qExtent` which can convert itself into the format needed by the API query. You
can use an existing polygon to create your extent by specifying the coordinates
yourself, or by using a polygon from another source, such as a shapefile.

There are several convenience functions to create common extent types, which
don't require you to already have a polygon:

* `extent_from_bbox()`
* `extent_from_radius()`
* `extent_from_bng()`
* `extent_from_ons_code()`

## Extent from Polygon

If you have a polygon that defines the area you would like to query, you can
pass this to `extent_from_polygon()`. This function will accept well-known text
(WKT) strings, simple features objects from the [`sf`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) (types `sf` or
`sfc`), or polygon objects from the [`geos`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=geos). This example
shows how you can construct an extent to query the NGD Features API for all the
buildings within a rectangle.

```{r setup, tidy=FALSE}
library(osdatahub)
library(geos)
```

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Set an environment variable with you OS Data Hub API key.
# set_os_key('[YOUR KEY]')

# Define a rectangle by coordinates using `geos`.
xcoords <- c(435000, 437500, 437500, 435000, 435000)
ycoords <- c(114500, 114500, 116000, 116000, 114500)

rectangle <- geos::geos_make_polygon(x = xcoords, y = ycoords)

# Need to define the type of coordinates you are using.
# These are British National Grid, which using EPSG code 27700.
crs <- 'EPSG:27700'

# Create the extent
polygon_extent <- extent_from_polygon(rectangle,
                                      crs = crs)
```

The extent is a type of list and it stores its polygon geometry as an `sf`
object in an item named `polygon`, so we can plot it on a map to check it covers
the area we wanted.

```{r extent-from-poly, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(maptiles)

# sf polygon of extent
polygon <- polygon_extent$polygon

# define the tile server parameters
osmaps <- list(src = 'OS Maps',
               q = 'https://api.os.uk/maps/raster/v1/zxy/Light_3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?key=XXXXXX',
               sub = '',
               cit = 'Contains OS data Â© Crown copyright and database rights, 2023.')

# download tiles and compose basemap raster
poly_maps <- get_tiles(x = polygon,
                       provider = osmaps,
                       crop = FALSE,
                       cachedir = tempdir(),
                       apikey = get_os_key(),
                       verbose = FALSE)

# Plot the extent
plt <- tm_shape(poly_maps, bbox = polygon) +
        tm_rgb() +
        tm_shape(polygon) +
        tm_borders(lty = 'dashed', lwd = 2) +
        tm_grid(labels.format = list(big.mark = ""),
                lines = FALSE) +
        tm_credits(osmaps$cit)

plt
```

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# The extent is then passed to the API to use in the query
results <- query_ngd(polygon_extent,
                     collection = 'bld-fts-buildingpart-1',
                     max_results = 100000,
                     returnType = 'sf',
                     key = get_os_key())

# When querying a large area or a dense data product,
# you may need to increase the max results limit to get all the data
```

```{r extent-with-buildings, tidy=FALSE}
# Plot the results on the existing map
plt <- plt +
  tm_shape(results) +
  tm_fill(col = 'darkblue')

plt
```

## Extent from Bounding Box

If your extent is rectangular, instead of specifying all the coordinates and
constructing a polygon, you can use the `extent_from_bbox()` function, which
only requires the coordinates of the South-West and North-East corners in the
order (west, south, east, north). This results in the same extent object as the
previous example, just in fewer lines of code.

You might use this if you want to return data that covers an area currently
visible in a web map, or if you want to match the bounds of another data source,
such as a raster, geodataframe or shapefile.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Using the same coordinates as the previous example
west <- 435000
south <- 114500
east <- 437500
north <- 116000

bbox_extent <- extent_from_bbox(c(west, south, east, north),
                                crs = 'EPSG:27700')

# Check that both approaches give the same result
print(paste0('Extents are equal: ', bbox_extent$wkt == polygon_extent$wkt))
```

## Extent from Radius

`extent_from_radius()` is a convenient way to query for data within a certain
distance of a point location. This method can only used with `crs =
'EPSG:27700'` and `crs = 'EPSG:3857'`, which are projected coordinate systems
and use units of meters. If you are using longitude and latitude, you will need
to convert to one of the two supported projections first.

This example shows how you can query for all road nodes within 200m of a point
location.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
point <- c(441317, 112165)
distance <- 200

radial_extent <- extent_from_radius(centre = point,
                                    radius = distance,
                                    crs = 'EPSG:27700')

results <- query_ngd(radial_extent,
                     collection = 'trn-ntwk-roadnode-1',
                     crs = 'EPSG:27700',
                     max_results = 10000,
                     returnType = 'sf')

print(paste0('There are ', nrow(results), ' roadway nodes within ',
             distance, 'm of (', point[1], ', ', point[2], ').'))

```

```{r extent-from-radius, tidy=FALSE}

# download tiles and compose basemap raster
poly_maps <- get_tiles(x = radial_extent$polygon,
                       provider = osmaps,
                       crop = FALSE,
                       cachedir = tempdir(),
                       apikey = get_os_key(),
                       verbose = FALSE)

# Plot the query results
plt <- tm_shape(poly_maps, bbox = radial_extent$polygon) +
        tm_rgb() +
        tm_shape(radial_extent$polygon) +
        tm_borders(lty = 'dashed', lwd = 2) +
        tm_shape(results) +
        tm_dots(col = 'darkblue', size = .5) +
        tm_grid(labels.format = list(big.mark = ""),
                lines = FALSE) +
        tm_credits(osmaps$cit)

plt
```

## Extent from National Grid Code

The National Grid provides a unique spatial reference system for Great Britain
across multiple spatial scales. A series of grid squares measuring 100km covers
Great Britain. These squares are further divided into smaller squares. The
smaller squares are identified by numbers of 'eastings' and 'northings'.
Combining the letters and numbers generates a British National Grid (BNG) code
that can identify a grid square location. More information on BNG codes is
available
[here](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/documents/resources/guide-to-nationalgrid.pdf).

The BNG square can be represented as a polygon geometry where the length of the
side equal to the scale of the grid reference.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Identify a BNG square
bngcode <- 'SU3715'
bng_extent <- extent_from_bng(bngcode)

# The CRS will always be EPSG:27700 for BNG extents.
print(bng_extent)
```

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Query the API
results <- query_ngd(bng_extent,
                     collection = 'bld-fts-buildingpart-1',
                     crs = 'EPSG:27700',
                     max_results = 10000,
                     returnType = 'sf')
```

```{r extent-from-bng, tidy=FALSE}
# download tiles and compose basemap raster
poly_maps <- get_tiles(x = bng_extent$polygon,
                       provider = osmaps,
                       crop = FALSE,
                       cachedir = tempdir(),
                       apikey = get_os_key(),
                       verbose = FALSE)

# Plot the results
plt <- tm_shape(poly_maps, bbox = bng_extent$polygon) +
        tm_rgb() +
        tm_shape(bng_extent$polygon) +
        tm_borders(lty = 'dashed', lwd = 2) +
        tm_shape(results) +
        tm_fill(col = 'darkblue') +
        tm_grid(labels.format = list(big.mark = ""),
                lines = FALSE) +
        tm_credits(osmaps$cit)

```

## Extent from ONS Code

The Office for National Statistics maintains a source of official geographies
for the UK, such as county boundaries, electoral wards, parishes, and census
output areas. These boundaries are commonly used for data analysis, particularly
of socio-economic factors. You can automatically define a query extent by using
the ONS code for the particular area you are interested in, making it easy to
combine geospatial information with other data sources, such as census records.
A full list of available codes can be found
[here](https://statistics.data.gov.uk:443/atlas/resource?uri=http://statistics.data.gov.uk/id/statistical-geography/K02000001).
This example shows how you can find all the buildings in a particular electoral ward.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# This is the ONS code for the Woolston electoral ward in Southampton.
ward <- 'E05002470'
electoral_extent <- extent_from_ons_code(ward)

# The CRS cannot be set when requesting an ONS geography.
print(electoral_extent)
```

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
# Query the API
results <- query_ngd(electoral_extent,
                     collection = 'bld-fts-buildingpart-1',
                     crs = 'EPSG:27700',
                     max_results = 10000,
                     returnType = 'sf')
```

Next we can plot the results, however, the basemap has a CRS of EPSG:3857 and
the data has a CRS of EPSG:4326, so we need to convert the data so that it
aligns correctly with the basemap first. We could choose to convert the basemap
to match the data instead, but it results in a warped looking plot.

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
results <- st_transform(results, crs = 3857)
extent_poly <- st_transform(electoral_extent$polygon, crs = 3857)
```


```{r extent-from-ons, tidy=FALSE}
# download tiles and compose basemap raster
poly_maps <- get_tiles(x = extent_poly,
                       provider = osmaps,
                       crop = FALSE,
                       cachedir = tempdir(),
                       apikey = get_os_key(),
                       verbose = FALSE)

# Plot the results
plt <- tm_shape(poly_maps, bbox = extent_poly) +
        tm_rgb() +
        tm_shape(extent_poly) +
        tm_borders(lty = 'dashed', lwd = 2) +
        tm_shape(results) +
        tm_fill(col = 'darkblue') +
        tm_grid(labels.format = list(big.mark = ""),
                lines = FALSE) +
        tm_credits(osmaps$cit)

plt
```
